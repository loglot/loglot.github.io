as the context says, i made this for the Pirate Software Game Jam 16, from what i see, there aren't any public placements, apart from the main winners. the theme was "You are the Weapon"


full judge review:

>```I really struggled to get the control right, I think everything is too fast at the beginning and it could use being slowed down. You could perhaps scale it up as the game progressed. I unfortunately wasn't able to get to any upgrades, guess I need to "get good". I do like the concept of the high risk of using your health to attack, one weak point is once you have one shot left of health left it is basically game over as you cannot do anything. I enjoyed the visuals you used in you GDD, you could add more detail to that and also plan things like intended user experience. I would love to try it out again after it has been further refined :D.```
